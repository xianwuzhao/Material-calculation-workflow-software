# Material-calculation-workflow-software
In the field of materials design, high-throughput materials computing platforms play an increasingly important role. However, these platforms are currently not satisfactory and there is still much room for improvement in terms of automation, functionality, and interface aesthetics. In the form of a python plug-in, based on the existing materials integrated design intelligent platform MIDIS and materials computing cluster in the laboratory, we add functions related to magnetic property calculation and drawing, and improve the degree of calculation automation on the server side through shell scripts. . The automation function of material calculation has been further improved.
